 * A PSP module to implement the PSP time API via the VxWorks
 * vxTimeBaseGet() routine.  The VxWorks timebase is a 64 bit
 * monotonically increasing counter implemented as a hardware
 * register in PowerPC chips, and is described in the Power ISA
 * specification v2.06b section 7.2.
 *
 * The vxTimeBaseGet() function is provided by the VxWorks BSP and
 * returns the value of this register as a pair of UINT32 values,
 * containing the upper and lower 32 bit words.
 *
 * Note that the tick rate of the clock is not specified by Power
 * architecture and is system-dependent.  This needs to have some
 * platform-specific tuning to normalize the tick units.
