 *
 * A PSP module to satisfy the PSP time API on systems which
 * do not have a hardware clock register, but do provide a POSIX
 * compliant implementation of clock_gettime() and CLOCK_MONOTONIC
 * that can fulfill this role.
 *
 * The POSIX CLOCK_MONOTONIC is defined as a monotonically increasing
 * clock that has no specific epoch.  It is not affected by local time
 * changes and is not settable.
 *
 * The POSIX interface uses a "struct timespec" which has units in
 * nanoseconds, but this is converted down to units of microseconds for
 * consistency with previous versions of PSP where CFE_PSP_Get_Timebase()
 * returned units of microseconds.

 * The specific clock ID to use with clock_gettime

 * Linux provides some special (non-posix) clock IDs that also
 * could be relevant/useful:
 *
 * CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE - emphasis on read speed at the (possible?) expense of precision
 * CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW - possibly hardware based, not affected by NTP or other sync software
 * CLOCK_BOOTTIME - includes time the system is suspended.
 *
 * Defaulting to the POSIX-specified "MONOTONIC" but it should be possible to use
 * one of the Linux-specific variants if the target system provides it.
