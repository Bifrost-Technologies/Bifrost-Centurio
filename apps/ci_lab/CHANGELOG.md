## _**OFFICIAL RELEASE: v2.3.0 - Aquila**_
- Minor updates (see <https://github.com/nasa/ci_lab/pull/12>)
- Not backwards compatible with OSAL 4.2.1

## Known issues
Dependence on cfe platform config header is undesirable, and the check is not endian safe. As a lab application, extensive testing is not performed prior to release and only minimal functionality is included.
