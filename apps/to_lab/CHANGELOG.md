## Development Build: v.2.4.0-rc1+dev13

- Replaces deprecated SB API's with MSG

- Update the TLMsockid field to be `osal_id_t` instead of uint32
- Set revision number to 99 to indicate development status in telemetry
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/59>

## Development Build: v.2.4.0-rc1+dev6

- Adds header guard to `to_lab_sub_table.h`

## Development Build: v.2.4.0-rc1+dev3

- Remove reference to deprecated `CFE_ES_SHELL_TLM_MID`.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/58>

## Development Build: v2.3.0+dev45

- Fixes bug where an unset address values caused subscriptions to MsgId 0 over 200 times. Added a `TO_UNUSED` entry at the end of the subscription list and a break in the subscription loop when `TO_UNUSED` found. No more subscriptions on the unused table slots (no MsgId 0 subscriptions).
- Corrects return value of `TO_LAB_init()` to be `int32` instead of `int`. Declaration now matches definition, and app builds without errors.
- Add build number and baseline to version reporting.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/53>

- Makes the `TO_LAB_Subs` table into a CFE_TBL-managed table.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/46>


## Development Build: v2.3.6

- Replace references to `ccsds.h` types with the `cfe_sb.h`-provided type.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/44>

## Development Build: v2.3.5

- Apply code style
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/43>

## Development Build: v2.3.4

- Configure the maximum depth supported by OSAL, rather than a hard coded 64.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/39>

## Development Build: v2.3.3

- Apply the CFE_SB_MsgIdToValue() and CFE_SB_ValueToMsgId() routines where compatibility with an integer MsgId is necessary - syslog prints, events, compile-time MID #define values.
- Deprecates shell tlm subscription
- Changes to documentation
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/38>
