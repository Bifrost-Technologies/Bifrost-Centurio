# Core Flight System : Framework : Tool : Ground System

This repository contains NASA's Lab Ground System (cFS-GroundSystem), which is a framework component of the Core Flight System.

This lab application is a non-flight utility ground system to interact with the cFS. It is intended to be located in the `tools/cFS-GroundSystem` subdirectory of a cFS Mission Tree. The Core Flight System is bundled at <https://github.com/nasa/cFS> (which includes cFS-GroundSystem as a submodule), which includes build and execution instructions.

See [Guide-GroundSystem.md](https://github.com/nasa/cFS-GroundSystem/blob/master/Guide-GroundSystem.md) for more information.

## Known issues

As a lab application, extensive testing is not performed prior to release and only minimal functionality is included.
